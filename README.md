== So Auth Provider

This is a small app to demonstrate how to use
[doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) to add OAuth2
provider functionality to a Rails app that uses
[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for user
authentication.

The [so_auth](https://github.com/jagthedrummer/so_auth) gem can be used
to allow any Rails app to delegate authentication to this provider. See
the [so_auth_client](https://github.com/jagthedrummer/so_auth_client)
project for a working example of using this gem.

See (http://www.octolabs.com/so-auth)[http://www.octolabs.com/so-auth]
for more details.
